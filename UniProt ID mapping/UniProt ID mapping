These datasets can be used in case that UniProt ID mapping online tool is unavailable. 
Just a note: These datasets can only be used in cases of conversion from a protein to the equivalent gene name, and vice versa.
The file 'idmapping_acc.csv' contains all the human reviewed proteins with their UniProt accession (e.g. P01308), accompanied with the equivalent primary gene name.
The file 'idmapping_id.csv' contains all the human reviewed proteins with their UniProt id (e.g. INS_HUMAN), accompanied with the equivalent primary gene name
The code is also provided.
